#Simple Editor


Inspiration:
 Cloud 9
 Ace Editor
 Bracket
 Sublime Text 2
 Code Mirror

 I essentially took the parts I liked from all editors and try to smash them together.


#MVP
 - Edit existing JS, HTML, CSS files. (Open, Save, Save As, Close without saving)
 - Create new JS, HTML, CSS Files.
 - View files in a directory and sub folders.
 - Open Files in one Simple Editor.



 #Nice to Have
  - Different edit layout,  2 cols (ver/hor)
  - Support for PHP, Python (Other people can add the other editors)
  - Menu items.
