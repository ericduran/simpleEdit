# Plugins

I want to make it plugable. That being said, I need to look at how other editors do it.
I don't like how sublime text does it. I much rather drop plugins in ~/.simpleEdit
even if that's not standard.

Anyways, recomendation welcome. Not really sure plugins will go out when this is made public.
