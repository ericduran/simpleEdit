Notes & Ideas

Tabs:
  <li data-uri="file:///home/etc/workspace/file/name.js">
    <span>name.js</span>
    // I'm going to try to avoid <a>.
  </li>


Editor ALWAYS has focus!!!!!
 - If a user clicks on the file, the editor instance for that file has FOCUS
 - If a user clicks a tab, the editor for that tab has FOCUS
 - No matter what a user clicks, the corresponding editor has FOCUS


Ace Editor vs CodeMirror:
 - So ace doesn't really play nice with window resizing. It's not horrible it's just CodeMirror is a lot simpler
